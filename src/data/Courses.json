I would tell them that we hit a little bit of everything from how information, like texts and YouTube videos travels from point \"A\" to your computer, to how to code drawings in JavaScript and make apps.  You can use this class to get an idea on what you like to do, you are not going to like everything, but you will find something.  Also, I would recommend learning this stuff now, because in the world we are living in, everything in centered around technology and computers, the more you understand, the better."

This class is great to experience, because it is like no other.  I would persuade them by saying that you will lose nothing by at least trying computer science because you will never know how you really feel until you try something.  I would tell them to possibly even aide for a day or two for this class and to see how they like it.
